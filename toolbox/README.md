   Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa Su
                   1  2
    3  4  5  6  7  8  9
   10 11 12 13 14 15 16
   17 18 19 20 21 22 23
   24 25 26 27 28
  ```
  Useful flags include `-y` for the whole year, and `-3` for the surrounding months.

- **Obsidian**: Talked about at length by [Joe](https://github.com/HallJoseph), but it's a neat note taking and organsing piece of software. Link: https://obsidian.md/. Free to use, but has a premium plan allowing cloud back ups. My get around for that is to keep Obsidian in the OneDrive section on my Mac which uses the 2 TB of university provided cloud storage.
